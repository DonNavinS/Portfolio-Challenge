# Portfolio-Challenge
First attempt at creating a website that acts as a personal portfolio using HTML and CSS. 
No fancy designs, but the site is functional and responsive when rescaled.
Only placeholder images were used, and can be replaced with real images as I complete my own projects and develop my own portfolio.
Future improvements will come as I develop my skills and have more useful traits to appeal to potential employers. With more information available, I can then change the layout of the site as well to showcase things other than just my projects (skills, specialties, strengths).
